# Barbell Strategy Audit

## Purpose
Check if you're in fragile middle (moderate risk, moderate reward) or proper barbell (extreme safety + extreme risk).

## Three Barbells to Audit

### 1. FINANCIAL BARBELL
**Question:** Is your income extreme safety + extreme risk, or lukewarm middle?

**Extreme Safety (70%):**
- [ ] Boring client work that pays reliably
- [ ] Covers all basic expenses + buffer
- [ ] Low excitement, high predictability

**Extreme Risk (30%):**
- [ ] Speculative bets (crypto, new ventures, creative projects)
- [ ] High upside potential, capped downside
- [ ] Could 10x, could go to zero

**Fragile Middle (AVOID):**
- [ ] Moderate-paying job you're only half-committed to
- [ ] Not safe enough to relax, not risky enough for big upside
- [ ] "Golden handcuffs"

**Your Status:** Barbell ☐ / Fragile Middle ☐

### 2. ATTENTION BARBELL
**Question:** Is your focus extreme work + extreme rest, or constant moderate distraction?

**Extreme Focus (4-6 hours/day):**
- [ ] Deep work blocks (no phone, no interruptions)
- [ ] All-in on one task
- [ ] Flow state accessible

**Extreme Rest (2-3 hours/day):**
- [ ] DMN sessions (no task, no phone)
- [ ] Walking, strangers, boredom
- [ ] True recovery

**Fragile Middle (AVOID):**
- [ ] Half-working (Slack open, checking phone every 10 min)
- [ ] Half-resting (scrolling, "relaxing" with content consumption)
- [ ] Never fully present, never fully off

**Your Status:** Barbell ☐ / Fragile Middle ☐

### 3. EXPLORATION BARBELL
**Question:** Is your life extreme routine + extreme novelty, or constant moderate change?

**Extreme Routine (70%):**
- [ ] Same morning ritual everywhere
- [ ] Predictable work blocks
- [ ] Stable base (brain doesn't waste energy predicting)

**Extreme Novelty (30%):**
- [ ] Deep dives into new places (2-3 months minimum)
- [ ] Total immersion (language, culture, locals)
- [ ] Digestion time (DMN processes)

**Fragile Middle (AVOID):**
- [ ] Moving every 2 weeks (no digestion)
- [ ] FOMO-driven travel ("must see everything")
- [ ] Constant low-level novelty (never settles, never deeply explores)

**Your Status:** Barbell ☐ / Fragile Middle ☐

## OVERALL AUDIT

**3/3 Barbells:** Antifragile  
**2/3 Barbells:** Robust (watch the weak point)  
**1/3 Barbells:** Fragile (high burnout risk)  
**0/3 Barbells:** Crisis (immediate restructure needed)

**Next Action:** Pick weakest barbell, design correction this week.
