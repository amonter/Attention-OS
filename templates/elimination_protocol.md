# Via Negativa Elimination Protocol

## Principle
Robustness comes from subtraction, not addition. Remove what weakens before adding what strengthens.

## Process

### STEP 1: Inventory (What You Currently Carry)
List everything consuming your attention/resources/energy:

**Physical:**
- Possessions: ___
- Subscriptions: ___
- Locations/commitments: ___

**Digital:**
- Apps on phone: ___
- Subscriptions/services: ___
- Notifications enabled: ___

**Mental:**
- Projects in progress: ___
- Commitments made: ___
- Relationships maintained: ___

---

### STEP 2: Elimination Test
For each item, ask:
1. **"Can I leave/quit/cancel in 20 minutes?"**
   - If NO → Identify what's trapping you (lease, contract, sunk cost)
2. **"Have I used/thought about this in past month?"**
   - If NO → Eliminate immediately
3. **"Does this align with my mission statement?"**
   - If NO → Eliminate or renegotiate
4. **"Is this extreme safety or extreme risk?"**
   - If neither (fragile middle) → Eliminate or convert to barbell

### STEP 3: Progressive Elimination
**Week 1: Digital**
- [ ] Turn off ALL notifications (yes, all)
- [ ] Delete social apps from home screen
- [ ] Unsubscribe from 10 email lists

**Week 2: Physical**
- [ ] Donate/sell 20% of possessions
- [ ] Cancel 2 subscriptions you barely use
- [ ] Can you pack in 20 minutes? If no, eliminate until yes

**Week 3: Mental**
- [ ] Audit all projects: All-in or opt-out (no lukewarm)
- [ ] Cancel 1 commitment you're doing out of obligation
- [ ] Via negativa mission check: Define what you refuse to do

**Week 4: Sunk Costs**
- [ ] List 3 things you're doing because "I've already invested..."
- [ ] Run Sunk Cost Detector prompt on each
- [ ] Eliminate at least 1

---

### STEP 4: Maintenance
**Quarterly Purge:**
- Re-run this protocol every 3 months
- Entropy returns (possessions, commitments creep back)
- Elimination is ongoing practice, not one-time event

**20-Minute Test:**
- Can you leave your current location in 20 minutes?
- If not, what's trapping you? Eliminate that.
