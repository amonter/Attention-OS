## What is Attention-OS?

Most AI systems optimize for **engagement** (feeds, ads, notifications). Attention-OS is different: it's designed to **defend your attention**, not exploit it.

This repository contains:
- **System prompts** for Defensive AIs (journaling feedback, decision audits, mission alignment)
- **Templates** for managing attention as capital (balance sheets, barbell audits, elimination protocols)
- **Frameworks** from 17 years of startup building + 9 years of nomadic field-testing

**Core Principle:** Build on Lindy practices (time-tested for 1,000+ years). Use AI to accelerate, not replace.

## Why "Defensive AI"?

**Exploitative AI:**
- Maximizes engagement (time on site)
- Prescribes actions (tells you what to do)
- Black box logic (you don't know why)
- Ambient interruption (notifications, feeds)
- Single perspective (reinforces bias)

**Defensive AI:**
- Protects attention (helps you think)
- Provides feedback (mirrors patterns, doesn't dictate)
- Transparent logic (explains reasoning)
- Opt-in only (you activate it)
- Multi-perspective (counterbalances bias)

## What's Inside

### `/prompts/`
Ready-to-use system prompts for:
- **Journaling feedback** (accelerate reflection)
- **Sunk cost detection** (flag loss aversion)
- **Mission alignment checks** (detect drift)
- **DMN companion** (post-boredom-session reflection)
- **Attention audits** (where does focus actually go?)
- **Multi-perspective decisions** (6 models, compare responses)

### `/templates/`
Frameworks for managing attention as capital:
- **Attention balance sheet** (assets vs liabilities)
- **Barbell audits** (are you in fragile middle?)
- **Elimination protocol** (via negativa checklist)
- **Mission statement** (define what you refuse)

### `/examples/`
Real-world usage:
- Sample journal entries + AI feedback
- Decision audits (anonymized)
- Mission statements
- Attention audits

---

## Quick Start

1. **Pick one prompt** (start with `journaling-feedback.md`)
2. **Copy system prompt** into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
3. **Test with real input** (journal entry, decision, etc.)
4. **Observe**: Does it help you think, or does it prescribe?
5. **Iterate**: Adjust prompt based on your needs

## Core Principles (The "Why")

### 1. Feedback > Prescription
AI should mirror your patterns, not tell you what to do. You maintain agency.

### 2. Multi-Perspective > Single Model
Query 6 models simultaneously. Divergence is data.

### 3. Lindy-Aligned > Neomania
Build on time-tested practices (boredom, journaling, walking). AI accelerates these—doesn't replace them.

### 4. Opt-In > Ambient
You activate Defensive AIs. They don't interrupt you.

### 5. Transparent > Black Box
AI explains its reasoning. You understand the logic.

## Context: The Book

This framework comes from **"From Burnout to Breakthrough: Reclaiming Attention Capital in the Age of AI"** by Adrian Avendano.

- 17 years building startups (Dublin, Startup Chile, NYC)
- 9 years as digital nomad (40+ countries)
- $7K lost in LUNA crash (skin in the game)
- COVID survival → AI pivot → Attention Capital OS emerged

**Book status:** Publishing January 2025  
**Early access:** [Link when available]

## Contributing

This is v1.0—it's rough, it's opinionated, it's incomplete.

**How to contribute:**
1. **Test prompts** → Open issues with results (what worked, what didn't)
2. **Submit new prompts** → PR with use case + example
3. **Share your mission statement** → Anonymized examples help others
4. **Translate** → Non-English prompts welcome
