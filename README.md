**Your attention is being hijacked. Here's the defense system.**

> **This is an open-source framework for protecting your focus and reclaiming your agency in the age of AI.**
>
> This repository provides a set of core protocols, defensive AI prompts, and mental frameworks to help you:
> * 🛡️ **Defend** your attention from digital hijacking.
> * 🧠 **Generate** original insights by activating your brain's "background processor."
> * 🤖 **Use AI** as a mirror for reflection, not a machine for prescription.

## 🏕️ What Happened in Mongolia

I was living in a yurt in Orkhon Valley. No electricity. No shower. Phone in battery-saving mode. Just me, the steppe, and silence.

For the first time in years, my internal voice became loud enough to hear.

I realized something: maybe I had valuable content inside me worth paying attention to, versus trying to listen to another podcast.

That moment changed everything.

I'd been running an attention operating system instinctively for 17 years—surviving startup collapse, LUNA crash, nomadic chaos across 90 countries. But I'd never formalized it.
**Mongolia gave me the silence to see the system.**

Now I'm giving it to you.

## ☕ Why This Exists

Three months ago, I watched my friend deflate over coffee in Bishkek.

> *"I can't focus anymore. My attention is constantly hijacked. AI is changing everything so fast. It's like I'm losing the ability to create."*

He'd started using AI to write video titles and descriptions. "It's faster," he said, "but something's missing."

**I recognized that look. I'd felt it after LUNA.**

Here's what's happening: AI doesn't just distract your attention like social media did—**it directs it**. It suggests decisions based on aggregate data, not your unique context. It optimizes your schedule for "productivity," not your creative flow.
By the time agentic AI arrives, most people will have forgotten how to set their own goals. They'll be operating systems running someone else's code.

**Here's what shook me most:** I've been working out daily for 11 years. Meditating daily for 11 years. Writing. Traveling. Building companies for 17 years.

**I still fell prey to hijack during LUNA.**

If I can lose my agency with all these defenses, how much harder is it for someone without them?

## 🛡️ The Three Core Protocols

In Mongolia's silence, I discovered three foundational patterns required to maintain agency:

### 1. 🧹 Garbage Collect Input
**Eliminate notifications and passive content to free up Attention Capital.**
This was the first change in the yurt. It delivered an immediate 20% regain of confidence. Turn off the noise. See what surfaces.

### 2. 🧠 Mind Wandering Loop
**Activate your Default Mode Network (DMN) for original insight generation.**
Your brain has a background processor that only works during boredom. It connects dots, spots patterns, generates breakthroughs. But it only turns on when you stop trying.
The train station moment in Mongolia—finding the impossible border crossing—that was DMN at work.

### 3. 💡 Reflection Loop
**Use AI as a mirror, not a prescription machine.**
Action → Feedback → Correction. Wander → Capture → AI feedback to structure thoughts and identify blind spots. This creates compounding cognitive growth.

Plus frameworks for adaptive focus, signal clarity, and conscious elimination.

## 🧰 What's in the Repo

### 1. Defensive AI Prompts
Ready-to-use system prompts that **mirror patterns back to you** instead of telling you what to do:
* [Input Auditor](prompts/attention_audio.md) (see your attention balance sheet)
* [Capture AI](prompts/capture_ai.md) (DMN session companion)
* [Journaling Feedback](prompts/journaling_feedback.md) (accelerate reflection without prescription)
* [Sunk Cost Detector](prompts/sunk_cost.md) (flag loss aversion)

### 2. Attention Capital Frameworks
Templates for managing attention like the finite resource it is:
* Balance Sheet (assets vs. liabilities)
* Barbell Audit (are you in the fragile middle?)
* Elimination Protocol (via negativa checklist)
* Mission Statement (define what you refuse)

### 3. The Philosophy
The book (coming 2025) explains the "why" behind every protocol. This repo gives you the "how."

## 👐 This Is Open Source. Here's Why.

**If I sell out or die, these protocols must live.**

Closed systems have single points of failure. This can't be one of them.

> *"I'm making this open source because it has to survive beyond me. Closed systems have single points of failure. This can't."*

Everything lives on GitHub. Every prompt. Every template. Every framework. Clone it. Break it. Prove me wrong. Every fork that improves this makes the defense stronger.

**This is collective defense, not individual optimization.**
You bring patterns from your domain—parenting, teaching, art, medicine, research. I bring patterns from nomadic adaptation. Together we build something antifragile.

## 🚀 Your First Move

**This week, do what I did after the valley:**

**Turn off your notifications.**

Not all of them—keep family, health, anything truly urgent. But silence the ambient hum. The feeds. The "someone liked your post" pings. The news alerts. The app badges.

That's it. That's the whole assignment.

When I did this, I expected to feel anxious, like I was missing something. Instead, my mind began to wander in ways it hadn't in years. Ideas that had been buried under constant input started floating back up.

**Run the experiment. Track what surfaces.**

Then come back and grab the [Input Auditor prompt](prompts/attention_audio.md). See where your attention *actually* goes versus where you *think* it goes.

## 🌊 The Stakes

We're emerging from the social media wave—benefits undeniable, side effects massive. Now a much larger wave rises: AI.

Unlike before, **we have no defense mechanisms, no adaptive frameworks, no philosophy** for the scale of change it's about to unleash—not only on attention and focus, but on work, identity, and human skill.

**If we don't build defenses now, we risk losing agency entirely.**

Because attention isn't just focus. It's the fundamental mental unit that holds our capacity for creativity, learning, and flow together.

A fragmented mind can't enter flow. And in flow, something remarkable happens: the brain quiets its self-monitoring chatter and redirects energy toward focused, goal-directed processing. Inner doubts fade. Rigidity softens. The mind becomes more playful, more combinatorial—better able to connect dots in new ways.

**That's adaptability in action.**

---

## meta The Meta-Proof

I'm writing the book using this system. You're watching Attention OS in action.

Every chapter. Every edit. Every structural decision—powered by the three core loops.

**If the system works, you'll see it in the clarity of the final book.**

---

## 📣 The Call

The question isn't whether AI will reshape attention. **It already has.**

The question is: **will you design your own defense? Or let someone else design it for you?**

I'm building the fence. You're invited to fortify it.

**Let's go.**
